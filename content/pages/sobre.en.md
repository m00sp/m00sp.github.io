This is a trilingual static site: Portuguese, Spanish and English, made by [Luis Ricardo Martínez Díaz](https://github.com/m00sp) using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), the static site generator written in Rust, the [Abridge](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge) theme and the [Registro.br](https://registro.br) domain.

The site provides an example of the type of site that i can make for service providers and small or medium-sized companies, using the .br domain [Categories](https://registro.br/dominio/categorias/) offered by Registro.br.

The site was developed to be fast and lightweight, using semantic html, CSS and No Mandatory JS. If you want to known more about the site's features and scoring, read the Site [Overview](@/blog/resumo/index.en.md), where there is a more detailed explanation.
