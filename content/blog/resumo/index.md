### Search Suggestions

To try it as an example press `/` key, type rust, use arrows for move, `enter` to select or `escape` to close. To see the search results page type the search query and hit `Enter Key` or `click` the search button icon.


### Pagination

I can set the number of home page or post page items for section pages. I use three for my [Blog](https://luis-ti.dev.br/blog/) as an example.

### Footer Social Icons

I can configure your site with the social icons that you use the most (this makes your site size smaller and faster).

Or i can simply turn them all off if you don't want to use any of them.

### Dark or Light Themes

You can have your site with dark or light themes or i can set up a switcher button that allows the visitor to toggle the theme.

### SEO and Header Tags

For your post i can set a title less than 60 characters and a description between 80 and 160 characters in length. The description is what is displayed in search results below the page title.

I can also set page specific keywords for better positioning your site in search engines.

I can optionally set a page specific image for the search results.

### PWA, Progressive Web App

Luis-TI.dev.br site has PWA support. You can install the entire site as an app and have it work offline. To try it out simply use google chrome on your computer or phone.

If using Chrome on desktop then look at the end of the address bar for the install button. On Android you should get a popup to install, you can also install from the 3 dot menu in the top right corner. Once you have the PWA installed, you can go completely offline and you will still be able to browse or search the site!
